# UniNest

![UniNest Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/UniNest-All--in--One%20Campus%20App-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=graduation-cap)

UniNest is a friendly all‑in‑one campus app idea. Instead of jumping between many scattered systems (canteen menu, library site, random chat groups, paper notices), students and staff get one clean place to do daily tasks.

Our goal: Save time, reduce confusion, help new students feel included, and make campus life smoother.

## How It Helps a Student Day

**Morning**: Open app → See today's classes + weather → Decide to bring umbrella.  
**Before lunch**: Pre-order food → Skip queue.  
**Afternoon**: Check a library book → Reserve it.  
**Evening**: Add upcoming assignment → Timer starts.  
**Anytime**: Ask seniors "How to register for lab?" → Quick answer.  
**Lost wallet?** → Check Lost & Found.

## Simple User Stories

- As a fresher, I want to ask seniors questions without feeling shy.
- As a busy student, I want reminders so I don't miss deadlines.
- As a canteen vendor, I want to know orders ahead of peak time.
- As a librarian, I want fewer late returns.
- As a student, I want to quickly see if it will rain before a long walk.

## 🤝 Contributing (Team Flow)

1. Create a branch: `feat/short-description`
2. Write clean, simple commits.
3. Open a Pull Request with:
   - What changed
   - Why it matters
4. Get review → Merge.

We'll keep things simple at the start (maybe just a single repo).
